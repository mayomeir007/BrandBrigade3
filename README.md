This is a windows application that allows capturing a video from either a webcam or a file, detect
objects in the videoâ€™s frame, and show the frame and the detected objects using rectangles and
text-labels.

The C# part implements the GUI only, and delegates all the calls to a C++ dll.

In the C++ DLL, the following technologies are intgerated:

1. MediaLook MFormats SDK - for capturing the frames from the webcam and video files 
2. OpenCV's DNN module - for detecting objects in the frames
3. OpenCV - for drawing on the frames 
4. CLR windows forms - for displaying the frames on the panel window of the C# GUI
5. Finally, for calling C++ functions in a C# environment, I utilized data type marshalling

The dll also uses multithreading to enable switching between webcam, video file, and stopping options during runtime.
